### Components

If you're coming from `react` or similar library/framework, this is the same as your `component` directory.
If you're new to web development, the components contained in the `components`
directory are extensions for the different pages. I promise it's not as
confusing as it sounds.

### Example

If you have done any web development, you've likely stumbled upon different
tags. `<div> <body> <button> <radio> <a>` Each of these is a component of the
web page. If you want to customize them, but have them accessible to all of the
web pages, you put them in a components directory. Simple, right?
